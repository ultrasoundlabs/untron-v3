/*
 * Untron V3 Indexer API
 *
 * Read-only HTTP API served by PostgREST.  This schema contains only views. Each view exposes either: - canonical raw event data (`api.event_appended`), or - \"current state\" derived from events (views over `hub.*` and `ctl.*` versioned tables), or - append-only ledgers for actions (views over `hub.*_ledger` and `ctl.*_ledger` tables).  The underlying protocol is Untron V3: - hub (EVM): `UntronV3Index` emits a hash-chained event stream - controller (Tron): `UntronControllerIndex` emits a hash-chained event stream  All state shown here is derived deterministically from those streams and is reorg-safe.

/// ReceiverUsdtIndexerStatus : Receiver USDT transfer indexer status (tail + backfill).  The TRC-20 receiver transfer indexer has two moving parts: - a single shared tail cursor (`ctl.receiver_usdt_tail_cursor.next_block`), and - per-receiver backfill cursors (`ctl.receiver_watchlist.backfill_next_block`).  Relayers should generally avoid acting on receiver-transfer-derived state unless: - `min_backfill_next_block` is NULL (no pending backfills), and - `tail_next_block` is close to the Tron head (with the relayer's own head check).
