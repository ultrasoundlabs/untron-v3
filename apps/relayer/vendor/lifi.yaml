        `Token` and the `toAmountMin`, which is the guaranteed minimum value that the transfer will yield including
        slippage.

      description: >-
        In order to execute any transfer, you must first request possible `Routes`. From the result set a `Route` can be
        selected and executed by retrieving the transaction for every included `Step` using the `/steps/transaction`
        endpoint.
