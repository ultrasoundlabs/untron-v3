IMPORTANT: Tron's VM is in most parts equivalent to EVM, so one should be able to understand the idea entirely with just EVM knowledge. It might even be that we port Tron parts of the protocol to EVM-ish chains like BNB Chain at some point

UntronController (Tron):
1. Deploys UntronReceiver contracts on Tron using CREATE2
2. Has unique right to forward TRC-20 tokens from UntronReceiver contracts' balances to an arbitrary Tron address
3. Can forward its balance in any TRC-20 token to its designated Layer Zero-compliant bridge (e.g. USDT0's The Legacy Mesh for sending USDT from Tron to Arbitrum). The bridges' parameters (token address -> LZ bridge address, fee logic, static recipient, etc.) are configured on the contract level by governance, so that it can e.g. switch from USDT0 as the "standard" bridge to any other Layer Zero-compliant bridge for USDT, or e.g. start supporting a LZ bridge for EURT deposits at some point.
4. Lets everyone ask the UntronController to pull any TRC-20 token from itself and, if it has an LZ bridge configured for this token, push it through the bridge using static parameters configured by the governance.
5. Lets Executor address, elected by governance, use UntronController to forward TRC-20 tokens from UntronReceiver contracts to any address and not just UntronController, using UntronController's unique right to do so. If Executor is not set, the only way to do something with the funds in the receiver is the default pull+bridge flow, configured by governance.

UntronReceiver (Tron):
Very simple contract, probably written in plain EVM assembly, that, when called:
1. Parses TRC-20 token address, amount, and recipient from calldata
2. Checks who's calling
3. If it's not UntronController, make sure that recipient == UntronController (UntronController is hardcoded into the code)
4. Executes TRC-20 transfer with given data
5. Forwards its status code and message to the caller
6. STOP

UntronManager (EVM):
1. Lets whitelisted addresses "lease" receivers on Tron deployed by UntronController
2. "Lease" means that for specified duration, a specified address is eligible for an amount in specified tokens for every deposit to a specified receiver
    - This amount is defined as deposited amount minus specified percent fee (expressed in bps) minus specified flat fee.
    - Leases are created by "realtors," which in turn are EVM addresses whitelisted by governance.
    - Realtors can specify all of the params above that we describe as "specified" as long as it's within governance-specified floor and ceiling (if it's a number).
3.
